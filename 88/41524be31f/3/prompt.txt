<objective>

Review produced code through the lens of a cryptography and security testing expert. This command evaluates cryptographic implementations, validates security assumptions, and generates comprehensive test cases and edge cases.

**This command is NOT overwritten by GSD updates.**

**Use when:**
- After implementing cryptographic features
- Before merging security-critical code
- When you want test case ideas for crypto operations
- To validate security assumptions in the design

**Creates:**
- `.planning/security/REVIEW-[timestamp].md` — Security review report
- Test case suggestions (inline or as file)

## Project Security Rules

Reference the project's CLAUDE.md security rules:
- Never store privateKey in localStorage/sessionStorage
- Never log sensitive keys
- Never send unencrypted keys to server
- Always use ECIES for key wrapping
- Always use AES-256-GCM for content encryption
- Server NEVER has access to plaintext or unencrypted keys
- Always encrypt ipnsPrivateKey with TEE public key before sending
- TEE decrypts IPNS keys in hardware only, signs, and immediately discards

## Cryptographic Standards

| Algorithm | Use Case | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| AES-256-GCM | Content encryption | Authenticated encryption required |
| ECIES | Key wrapping | For asymmetric key transport |
| Web Crypto API | Browser crypto | No polyfills or JS implementations |
| Uint8Array | Binary data | Never strings for crypto data |

</execution_context>

<process>

## Phase 1: Scope Definition

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Review Scope"
- question: "What should I review?"
- multiSelect: false
- options:
  - "Specific files" — I'll provide file paths or patterns
  - "Recent changes" — Review uncommitted or recent commits
  - "Phase code" — Review code from a specific GSD phase
  - "Full crypto audit" — Comprehensive review of all crypto-related code

**If "Specific files":** Ask for file paths/patterns
**If "Recent changes":** Run `git diff` and `git diff --cached` to identify changed files
**If "Phase code":** Ask which phase, then read the phase's PLAN.md to identify relevant files
**If "Full crypto audit":** Search for crypto-related patterns across codebase

## Phase 2: Code Discovery

Based on scope, identify files to review:

```bash
# Find crypto-related files
grep -r -l "encrypt\|decrypt\|crypto\|Crypto\|cipher\|AES\|ECIES\|privateKey\|publicKey" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" . | grep -v node_modules | grep -v ".test."
```

Also search for:
- Key management code
- Authentication/authorization
- Data serialization of sensitive data
- API endpoints handling secrets
- Storage operations for keys

## Phase 3: Security Analysis

For each file/section, analyze through these lenses:

### 3.1 Cryptographic Correctness

- [ ] Correct algorithm usage (AES-256-GCM, not AES-CBC without MAC)
- [ ] Proper IV/nonce generation (crypto.getRandomValues, never predictable)
- [ ] IV/nonce never reused with same key
- [ ] Authenticated encryption used (GCM, not just encryption)
- [ ] Key sizes appropriate (256-bit for AES, appropriate curves for EC)
- [ ] No deprecated algorithms (MD5, SHA1 for security, DES, RC4)

### 3.2 Key Management

- [ ] Keys derived using proper KDF (not just hashing)
- [ ] Keys never logged or exposed in errors
- [ ] Keys cleared from memory after use
- [ ] Key hierarchy follows spec (rootFolderKey → folderKey → fileKey)
- [ ] Key wrapping uses ECIES as specified
- [ ] No hardcoded keys or secrets

### 3.3 Trust Boundaries

- [ ] Client-side encryption before any server transmission
- [ ] Server never receives plaintext keys
- [ ] TEE boundaries respected (encrypted IPNS keys only)
- [ ] No trust assumptions on server for key material

### 3.4 Implementation Safety

- [ ] Using Web Crypto API (not crypto-js or similar)
- [ ] Uint8Array for all binary data
- [ ] Constant-time comparison for authentication tokens
- [ ] No sensitive data in error messages
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Proper error handling (no silent failures in crypto)

### 3.5 Data Flow Security

- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted in transit
- [ ] No sensitive data in URLs or query params
- [ ] No sensitive data in localStorage/sessionStorage (except encrypted)
- [ ] Metadata leakage minimized

## Phase 4: Generate Test Cases

For each crypto operation found, generate test cases:

### Positive Test Cases
- Normal operation with valid inputs
- Boundary conditions (empty data, max size data)
- Different key types/sizes

### Negative Test Cases
- Invalid key format
- Corrupted ciphertext
- Wrong key for decryption
- Tampered authenticated data (GCM tag modification)
- Truncated ciphertext

### Edge Cases
- Empty plaintext encryption
- Very large data encryption (chunking behavior)
- Unicode/binary data handling
- Concurrent encryption operations
- Key rotation scenarios
- Re-encryption with new keys

### Attack Scenarios
- Replay attacks (nonce reuse detection)
- Padding oracle (if applicable)
- Timing attacks (constant-time operations)
- Key confusion attacks
- Downgrade attacks

## Phase 5: Generate Report

Create `.planning/security/` directory if needed:

```bash
mkdir -p .planning/security
```

Write review report to `.planning/security/REVIEW-[timestamp].md`:

```markdown

## Common Crypto Vulnerabilities to Check

### Nonce/IV Reuse
```typescript
// BAD: Reusing IV
const iv = new Uint8Array(12); // zeros!
// GOOD: Random IV each time
const iv = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(12));
```

### Missing Authentication
```typescript
// BAD: AES-CBC without MAC
// GOOD: AES-GCM (authenticated)
```

### Weak Key Derivation
```typescript
// BAD: Simple hash
const key = await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', password);
// GOOD: PBKDF2/Argon2 with iterations
```

### Timing Attacks
```typescript
// BAD: Early return on mismatch
if (a[i] !== b[i]) return false;
// GOOD: Constant-time comparison
```

### Key in Logs/Errors
```typescript
// BAD
console.log('Key:', key);
throw new Error(`Failed with key ${key}`);
// GOOD
console.log('Key operation failed');
throw new Error('Decryption failed');
```

### Predictable Randomness
```typescript
// BAD
Math.random()
// GOOD
crypto.getRandomValues()
```

ARGUMENTS: all of phase 14 work

[Request interrupted by user]

ok, lets commit the review as it is, and then address the following findings: H1, H2, H3, H4, M2, M3, M4, L2, L3, L4.

Findings not included in the above list can be fixed if it is not too deep a change.

Any findings that should be addressed but can be postponed should first create a gsd todo to ensure that these are tracked going forward.

Once done, update the security review with what was done, what was postponed, and commit this.
