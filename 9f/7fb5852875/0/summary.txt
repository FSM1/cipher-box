**Quick Task 010:** Matrix effect visibility

**What changed:**
- Matrix rain now visible through header, sidebar, and footer (backgrounds reduced to 50% opacity)
- Main content area stays opaque (90%) for readability
- Modal overlays show a dedicated matrix animation (35% opacity canvas)
- App-level canvas pauses when modal opens (only one canvas at a time = no performance hit)
- Frame rate bumped from 30fps to 60fps
- All CSS converted to modern `rgb()` notation

**Summary:** `.REDACTED.md`
**Commits:** `ba3ffd0` (app shell), `74d27b5` (modal + pause), `3c56541` (docs)
**Branch:** `feat/matrix-effect-visibility`
