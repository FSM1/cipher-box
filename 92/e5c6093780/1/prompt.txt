Implement the following plan:

# Fix FUSE Rename on SMB Backend

## Context

File rename (`mv`) fails with EPERM on the FUSE-T SMB backend. The macOS SMB client calls `access(W_OK)` on the parent directory before attempting rename. Our `access()` callback compares `req.uid()` against `attr.uid` — under SMB, these can differ because FUSE-T's internal SMB server proxies the request. When `access()` returns EACCES, the SMB client gives up with EPERM and our `rename()` callback is never reached.

Secondary issue: UID assignment is inconsistent — root/populated inodes use `getuid()` while `create()`/`mkdir()` use `req.uid()`, which can differ under SMB.

Since this is a single-user encrypted vault (encryption IS the access control), strict POSIX permission checks add no security value and actively break SMB.

## Changes

### 1. Simplify `access()` — always grant access
**File:** `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/fuse/operations.rs:2340-2376`

Replace strict UID + permission-bit checking with existence check + unconditional OK. Add trace-level log and doc comment explaining rationale.

### 2. Fix UID consistency in `create()`
**File:** `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/fuse/operations.rs:945-946`

Change `req.uid()`/`req.gid()` to `libc::getuid()`/`libc::getgid()` — matches root inode and `populate_folder()` patterns.

### 3. Fix UID consistency in `mkdir()`
**File:** `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/fuse/operations.rs:1853-1854`

Same change as #2.

### 4. Promote rename log to info level
**File:** `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/fuse/operations.rs:2132`

Change `log::debug!` to `log::info!` so rename operations are visible during testing without `RUST_LOG=debug`.

### 5. Update CLAUDE.md known limitations
**File:** `apps/desktop/CLAUDE.md`

Remove "Open issue" note, replace with "Fixed" note explaining the fix.

## Verification

1. Build desktop app, run with `--dev-key` mode
2. Create a file: `echo "test" > ~/CipherBox/testfile.txt`
3. Rename it: `mv ~/CipherBox/testfile.txt ~/CipherBox/renamed.txt`
4. Cross-folder move: `mkdir ~/CipherBox/sub && mv ~/CipherBox/renamed.txt ~/CipherBox/sub/`
5. Confirm `rename:` info log appears (proves `access()` no longer blocks)
6. Run `cargo test --features fuse` for unit tests

ok, but all verification can be done automatically with the --dev-key flag

Im just referring to the logging that was modified for debugging this issue
