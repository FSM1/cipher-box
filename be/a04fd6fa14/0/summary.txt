That's it. Now `userEmail` is:
- **Hydrated from localStorage** on store creation (survives refresh/session restore)
- **Persisted to localStorage** when set during login
- **Cleared from localStorage** on logout

The email isn't sensitive data, so this is safe — unlike tokens or keys which stay memory-only.
