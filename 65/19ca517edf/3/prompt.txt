we need to come up with a strategy to enable e2e testing of the sharing flows. I would prefer that the sharing flows are actually tested properly, with multiple accounts to ensure all the complex flows, such as updating an existing share (1 owner + 1 viewer) to add more users (1 owner + 2 viewers), as well as a bunch of other various complex interactions, such as adding files after a share has been created (both to the root of the share as well as to a child folder). How much additional testing infra is needed to enable these sort of flows?
