# Agent Learnings

This folder contains learnings from AI-assisted development sessions. Each entry captures insights that help future sessions work more effectively in this codebase.

## When to Create an Entry

Create an entry after completing a significant task that involved:
- Learning something non-obvious about the codebase
- Getting stuck and finding a solution
- Discovering patterns or gotchas worth remembering

## File Naming

`YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md`

Example: `2026-02-06-discord-style-usernames.md`

## Entry Structure

```markdown
# [Brief Title]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Original Prompt

> [Full prompt text as provided by user - preserving exact wording helps improve future prompts]

## What I Learned

Bullet points of non-obvious discoveries:
- Gotchas and edge cases
- Codebase patterns
- Data structure quirks
- Things that look similar but behave differently

## What Would Have Helped

Information that would have made the task smoother if known upfront:
- Missing context from the prompt
- Files I should have checked first
- Clarifying questions I should have asked

## Key Files

## Guidelines

- **Be concise** - Future you wants quick insights, not a novel
- **Focus on learnings** - Skip implementation details that are obvious from the code
- **Highlight gotchas** - The non-obvious stuff is most valuable
- **Think reusability** - What would help with similar tasks in the future?
