and now there are more valid comments from coderabbit. one of the comments relates to the construction of images in code - as a suggestion, why not jsut include all necessary media in the e2e test, so that these don't need to be generated every time, we can just use paths to existing files. especially for things like pdf and video (especially large video to test the aes-ctr code paths) will just be easier with real files.
