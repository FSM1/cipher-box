App is running. You'll need to log in through the Tauri webview. Once you're logged in and the mount appears, let me know and I'll test the read/write operations.

The changes I made:

1. **`read()` now poll-waits** for up to 60 seconds instead of returning EIO immediately. This lets large file downloads complete before the NFS client gives up.

2. **`create()` marks parent as mutated** to prevent background refresh from wiping newly created files.

3. **`release()` uploads new files** (CID empty) even if no data was written, so `touch newfile` persists to IPFS.

Please log in and let me know when you're ready for testing.
