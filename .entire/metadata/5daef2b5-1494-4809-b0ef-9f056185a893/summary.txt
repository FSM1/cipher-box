Good, committed. The app is running and waiting for login. Please log in when ready and I'll test the FUSE operations.

Here's a summary of what was done in this session:

**Committed (10 commits on `feat/phase-11.1-01`):**

1. **Tray icons** — branded `>_` tray icon + green `>` app icons
2. **Login styling** — CipherBox green-on-black terminal aesthetic
3. **Google OAuth** — switched from GIS One Tap to OAuth2 implicit flow (popup)
4. **Public key format** — send uncompressed secp256k1 (130 hex chars) to backend
5. **dotenvy + API URL** — share `.env` between webview and Rust backend
6. **FUSE race conditions** — create/release mutation tracking, sync download in open()
7. **CLAUDE.md** — development notes
8. **Dev-key docs** — documented `--dev-key` mode and requirements
9. **Merge-only refresh** — background IPNS refresh preserves local files
10. **Read fallback** — read() downloads content if cache misses (handles NFSv3 stateless)

**Still pending:**
- Test file read/write after login
- Staging API needs `TEST_LOGIN_SECRET` + `NODE_ENV=staging` for `--dev-key` to work
- Remove `eprintln!(">>> ` debug lines before final merge
