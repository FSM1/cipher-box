Done. Here's what I set up:

- **`.env`** — All defaults filled in, pointing at staging API
- **`.env.example`** — Same values, committed to git as a reference
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — Notes on switching to local API when needed, plus Tauri webview constraints

The app will need a restart to pick up the new env vars (it was started with command-line overrides before). Want me to restart it?
