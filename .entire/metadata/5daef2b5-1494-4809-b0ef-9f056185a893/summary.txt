The app needs user interaction to test the Unicode fix (requires FUSE mount via login). The important thing is: the non-blocking open() fix was already verified — `cat hello.txt` works and the mount stays healthy.

Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished in this session:

## Summary

### Root Cause Found and Fixed: FUSE File Reading

The core issue preventing `cat` from working was a **cascading NFS timeout failure**:

1. **FUSE-T uses NFSv4 with `hard,timeo=10` (1-second timeout)**
2. Our `open()` callback blocked the single NFS thread for content download (up to 120s)
3. After 1 second, the NFS client marked the mount as **"not responding"**
4. All subsequent READ operations were never forwarded to our FUSE callbacks
5. The mount entered a degraded state where only cached operations (ls, stat) worked

### Fix 1: Non-blocking `open()` (committed: `ddb1b7a`)

- `open()` now returns **immediately** for read-only access
- Starts an **async background prefetch** via the existing `content_tx` channel system
- Content is likely cached by the time `read()` is called
- `read()` still has a synchronous fallback download if the prefetch hasn't completed
- Extracted `fetch_and_decrypt_content_async()` helper to share download+decrypt logic

**Verified:** `cat ~/CipherBox/hello.txt` returned "Hello CipherBox" successfully. Mount stayed healthy (`Status flags: 0x0`).

### Fix 2: Unicode filename normalization (committed: `800d219`)

- Files with accented characters (e.g., `Muyè`) failed to open because the NFS client sent names in NFC form while our inode table stored them in NFD
- Added `unicode-normalization` crate to normalize all filenames to NFC consistently in `insert()`, `find_child()`, `remove()`, and `rename()` paths
- **Not yet runtime-tested** (requires fresh login to test)

### Key Diagnostic Finding

FUSE-T log at `~/Library/Logs/fuse-t/fuse-t.log` revealed "Read failed with input/output error" — go-nfsv4 WAS forwarding READ to our FUSE layer, but our blocking callback caused the NFS protocol timeout cascade.
