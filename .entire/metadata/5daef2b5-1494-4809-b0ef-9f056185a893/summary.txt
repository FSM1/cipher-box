Good. The wallet button stays removed (no `window.ethereum` in Tauri webview), but Google is back. The Tauri app should auto-reload with the changes. 

Summary of what's done:
- **Google button**: Kept (removed wallet only — no wallet extensions in Tauri webview)
- **CORS fix**: Added `http://localhost:1420` to staging CORS config and restarted the API container
- Email login should now work — try submitting an email again
