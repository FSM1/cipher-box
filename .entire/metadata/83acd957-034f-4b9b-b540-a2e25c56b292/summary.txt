All three auth methods visible on the login page — Google (disabled/not configured), Email OTP, Wallet.

Here's the UAT summary from this Playwright session:

## UAT Results

| Test Case | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| ISSUE-004 | SecurityTab wired into SettingsPage | **PASS** |
| Tab Nav | ARIA tablist with LINKED METHODS / SECURITY tabs | **PASS** |
| Tab Switch | Both directions work, correct selected state | **PASS** |
| Security Tab | MFA [ENABLED] badge, factor count, device/recovery sections | **PASS** |
| Linked Methods | Email shown, unlink disabled (last method), link Google/Wallet buttons | **PASS** |
| VaultExport | Always visible below tabs | **PASS** |
| Email Login | OTP send, verify, Core Kit init, vault sync | **PASS** |
| TC09 | Wallet button visible, shows connector list | **PASS** |
| TC10 | Cancel returns to initial [WALLET] state | **PASS** |
| Logout | Redirects to login, token invalidated | **PASS** |

TC11 (no wallet) and TC12 (reject signature) are covered by the automated E2E tests (all 6 passed). TC09 full SIWE flow can't complete without a real backend wallet verifier in this environment, but mock wallet discovery + connector selection works.

MFA is already enabled on this test account so enrollment wizard (TC25-26) can't be re-triggered. The Security tab correctly shows the enabled state with factor info.

Everything looks solid. Do you see anything on your end you want me to dig into, or shall I mark this as "approved" and continue the execution?
