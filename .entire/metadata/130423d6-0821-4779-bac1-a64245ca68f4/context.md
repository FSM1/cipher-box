## Prompt

also why was the @.learnings/2026-02-07-atomic-file-upload.md todo get moved to `resolved` rather than `done`?

## Summary

Only one file in `resolved/`. That's from early in the project (Jan 22) — likely a one-off inconsistency before the `done/` convention was established. Want me to move it from `resolved/` to `done/` to keep things consistent?

## Key Actions

- - **Glob**: .planning/todos/**/*atomic*
- - **Glob**: .planning/todos/**/
- - **Bash**: List todo subdirectories
- - **Bash**: List resolved todos
