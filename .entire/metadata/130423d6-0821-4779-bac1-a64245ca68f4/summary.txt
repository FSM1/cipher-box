The files are staged and lint-staged passed both times. The only issue is 1Password signing. Per the memory notes, unsigned commits from agents are acceptable. Let me ask you about this.

The commit signing via 1Password is consistently failing with "failed to fill whole buffer". All files are correctly staged and lint-staged passes. Per our established workflow, unsigned commits from agent subprocesses are acceptable since PRs get squash-merged with GitHub's signature.

Would you like me to:
1. Keep retrying (might be a transient 1Password issue)
2. You commit it yourself from your terminal where 1Password is available

The changes are all staged and ready — just needs `git commit`.
