git commit -m "docs(planning): insert Phase 11.2 — Remove v1 Folder Metadata

Eliminate v1/v2 dual-schema code to fix cross-device format oscillation
bug where desktop writes v1 and web re-saves as hybrid v2 that the
desktop parser rejects, causing empty FUSE directories.

Phase 11.2 makes v2 (FilePointer) the only format, removes ~500 lines
of dual-schema types/dispatch/conversion, and adds per-file IPNS
publishing to desktop FUSE.
