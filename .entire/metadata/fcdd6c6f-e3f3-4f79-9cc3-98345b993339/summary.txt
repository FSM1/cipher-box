API is up with the persistent key. Now you can:

1. **Restart ngrok** to get a new URL
2. **Update the Web3Auth dashboard** `cipherbox-identity` verifier with the new JWKS URL: `<new-ngrok-url>/auth/.well-known/jwks.json`

Once you've updated the dashboard, let me know the new ngrok URL and we'll retry TC02.

Regarding the staging secret — noted. The `IDENTITY_JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` needs to be added as a GitHub secret in the `staging` environment before the next staging deploy. We should generate a separate key for staging (not reuse the dev key).
