Here's the UAT summary so far:

**Passed (10):** TC01, TC02, TC03, TC04, TC05, TC06, TC13, TC14, TC32, TC36
**Skipped (12):** TC07-12 (Google/Wallet — not available in dev), TC15-23 (MFA requires enrollment first), TC33-35 (multi-device/destructive)
**Blocked (7):** TC25-31 (ISSUE-004: SecurityTab not wired into SettingsPage)
**Noted (1):** TC24 (MFA prompt fires once per session, confirmed component exists)

**Key finding: ISSUE-004** — The Security tab with MFA enrollment, device management, and recovery phrase features exists in code (`SecurityTab`, `MfaEnrollmentWizard`, `RecoveryPhraseSection`) but is not accessible from the UI because `SettingsPage.tsx` doesn't include it.

The core email auth flow (login, invalid OTP, back nav, resend, rate limiting, session restore, redirect, logout, new user init) is fully passing. Want me to fix ISSUE-004 to unblock the MFA tests?
