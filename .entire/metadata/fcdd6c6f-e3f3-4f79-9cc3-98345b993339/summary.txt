**Logout → re-login: PASS!**

- `loginWithJWT` completed in 2s
- Navigated to `#/files`
- **"Synced"** status (green)
- **`test-folder` visible** — vault data persisted across logout/login cycle
- Storage: `2 KB / 500.0 MB`
- No crash, no infinite loop, no IPFS errors

Full end-to-end cycle confirmed: **Login → Create folder → Logout → Login → Vault synced with folder intact.**

TC02 (email login happy path) and TC13 (session restoration) are both verified. TC32 (logout) also confirmed working across multiple cycles.
