## Bug: Infinite polling loop crashes browser tab

**Root cause:** In `useDeviceApproval.ts`, `isPollingPending` was **React state** used both as:
1. A guard inside `pollPendingRequests` (in its `useCallback` deps)
2. Reset to `false` in `stopApproverPolling` (called in effect cleanup)

This created a dependency oscillation cycle:
- Effect starts polling → sets `isPollingPending = true` → re-render → `pollPendingRequests` gets new identity → effect cleanup fires → `stopApproverPolling` sets `isPollingPending = false` → re-render → `pollPendingRequests` gets new identity again → effect fires → starts polling again → **infinite loop**

Each cycle fired an immediate `void poll()` request, generating thousands of requests per second until Chrome ran out of network resources (`ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES` x 12,962).

**Fix:** Converted `isPollingPending` from `useState` to `useRef`. Refs don't trigger re-renders and don't change callback identities, breaking the oscillation cycle. The polling guard still works correctly — it just doesn't cause React to re-render.

**Files changed:** `apps/web/src/hooks/useDeviceApproval.ts` — 4 edits, all changing `isPollingPending` state to `isPollingPendingRef` ref.

This was **not** a CoreKit `loginWithJWT` crash as suspected in ISSUE-001 — it was the device approval polling running wild and starving the browser of network resources.
