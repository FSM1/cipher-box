Good - HMR picked up all changes. Here's a summary of the fixes applied:

**Root cause:** Infinite re-render cascade caused by unstable function references.

**Fixes applied:**

1. **`hooks.ts`** - Wrapped all `useCoreKitAuth()` functions in `useCallback` with `[coreKit]` or `[coreKit, syncStatus]` deps. Extracted `loginWithCoreKit` to a standalone module-level function `doLoginWithCoreKit()` that takes `coreKit` and `syncStatus` as parameters (no longer recreated on every render).

2. **`core-kit-provider.tsx`** - Wrapped context `value` in `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary consumer re-renders when unrelated provider state changes.

3. **`useAuth.ts`** - Replaced unstable function deps (`initializeOrLoadVault`, `coreKitLogout`) in the session restoration `useEffect` with stable refs (`initializeOrLoadVaultRef`, `coreKitLogoutRef`). The refs are updated on every render but don't trigger the effect to re-run.

4. **`main.tsx`** - Added error capture (DEBUG, temporary) that limits `console.error` output to 100 calls to prevent browser crash during debugging.

The Playwright MCP needs to be reconnected to continue testing. Could you reconnect it so we can verify the fix?
