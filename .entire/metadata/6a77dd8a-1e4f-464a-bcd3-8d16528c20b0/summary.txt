Playwright MCP disconnected from the earlier crash. Can you open a new browser tab to `http://localhost:5173` manually and try the email login flow? With the debug logging I just added, you should see `[CoreKit] loginWithJWT starting...` and then either `completed` or `FAILED` in the browser console (DevTools > Console).

Once you enter the OTP, I'll grab the real code from the API logs for you. When you're ready, enter the email and click SEND OTP, then let me know.
