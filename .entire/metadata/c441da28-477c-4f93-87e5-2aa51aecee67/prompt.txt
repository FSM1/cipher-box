ahhh whoops, must have gotten jumbled in the copy pasting - I was saying:

use this knowledge to create e2e tests for the wallet flows.

then make sure all of this is working by compeleting the wallet uat .

this should all be part of phase 12.5. 



PS. regarding the approaches proposed, I think I am starting to lean towards the using the wallet-mock package rather than rolling our own. this is not a financial app, and all we really use is signing a SIWE message.
