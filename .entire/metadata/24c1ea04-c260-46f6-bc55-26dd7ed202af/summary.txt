All done. Here's a summary of the three fixes:

1. **Heartbeat debounce** (`device-registry.service.ts`): Now compares `appVersion` and `deviceModel` before/after — debounce only applies when those haven't changed, so metadata updates always publish immediately.

2. **Async Ed25519 key derivation** (`derive-ipns.ts`): Switched `ed.getPublicKey()` to `await ed.getPublicKeyAsync()` — no longer relies on `sha512Sync` being set as a side effect from other module imports.

3. **JSON.parse error wrapping** (`encrypt.ts`): `JSON.parse` + `validateDeviceRegistry` now wrapped in try/catch — `CryptoError` from schema validation passes through, everything else becomes `CryptoError('DECRYPTION_FAILED')`.

All 162 tests pass, web build clean, pushed, and all 3 CodeRabbit threads replied to and resolved. PR #125 is ready to merge.
