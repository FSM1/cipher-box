ok can you start the dev server - redis and postgres are running on 192.168.133.114. also going to need ngrok set up to ensure that Web3Auth can communicate with the API to verify tokens. Once all that is done, let me know what the ngrok url is for the session so I can set it up on the w3auth dashboard. further instructions will be provided.

ok looks like the ngrok tunnel is already alive and set up on w3auth dashboard side.

@.planning/debug/corekit-auth-uat.md contains details of uat testing of all prs merged for phases 12, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.3.1, 12.4. continue with this, carefully appending a log of all steps taken to the file referenced above, to allow for better session continuity.

can you first kill all api and web server instances and start things off on a clean slate? do not restart ngrok as the url is stable and already wired up on w3auth dashboard.
