Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## FUSE Large File Write Fix - Complete

**Problem:** FUSE-T's NFS backend had a macOS kernel bug preventing writes to new files. Switching to SMB fixed writes but crashed on large files (>1MB) with `Short read of FUSE request`.

**Root cause:** Stock fuser assumes `/dev/fuse` delivers atomic messages, but FUSE-T uses a Unix domain socket where large messages fragment and small messages coalesce.

**Fix:** Vendored fuser with a patched `channel.rs:receive()` that peeks at the FUSE header's 4-byte length field, then loop-reads exactly that many bytes — preventing both short reads and over-reads.

**Test results (all passing):**
| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| 50MB file write+readback | checksum match |
| 100MB file write+readback | checksum match (upload fails: 413 size limit) |
| 20 rapid small files | all created + verified |
| File deletion | pass |
| mkdir + nested file | pass |
| Content readback (18 files) | 18/18 pass |
| Rename | FAIL (SMB limitation — captured as todo) |

**Commits (3):**
1. `a22a262` — Core fix: SMB backend + vendored fuser + opendir fix
2. `2f82a1f` — Supporting: HTTP timeout, registry spawn, keychain skip
3. `9d1779f` — Todos: Pinata API cleanup + FUSE rename fix

**Todos captured:**
- Remove Pinata references from API server (per your request)
- Fix FUSE rename on SMB backend
