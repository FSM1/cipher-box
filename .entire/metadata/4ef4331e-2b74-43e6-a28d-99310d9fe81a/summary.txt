Pushed. The three CI fixes:

1. **Test coverage** (82.89% < 84%): Added 3 tests — wallet-type inference in safety net, and both branches of the cross-account collision error message. Coverage now 85.52%.
2. **E2E build** (`Uint8Array` not `BlobPart`): TS 5.9 generic `Uint8Array<ArrayBufferLike>` doesn't satisfy `BlobPart`. Cast to `BlobPart` in both `ImagePreviewDialog.tsx` and `useFilePreview.ts`.
3. **API Spec & Client**: Was already correct from the CodeRabbit fix commit — CI just hadn't run against that code yet. The new push will trigger a fresh CI run.
