1Password agent is consistently failing. Per memory rules, I must NOT intentionally bypass signing. The lint checks pass — this is purely the signing agent being unavailable.

Could you try running this commit manually? The 1Password SSH agent isn't responding from this session. The files are already staged:

```bash
git add .planning/ROADMAP.md .planning/STATE.md .planning/phases/12.3-siwe-unified-identity/12.3-VERIFICATION.md && git commit -m "docs(12.3): complete SIWE + Unified Identity phase"
```

In the meantime, here's the phase completion summary:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 GSD ► PHASE 12.3 COMPLETE ✓
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Phase 12.3: SIWE + Unified Identity**

4 plans executed
Goal verified ✓ (5/5 must-haves)

| Plan | What was built |
|------|----------------|
| 12.3-01 | SiweService (viem), wallet endpoints, auth_methods schema, identifier hashing |
| 12.3-02 | ADR-001 removal — LoginType='corekit' only, clean auth/vault/verifier services |
| 12.3-03 | wagmi + WalletLoginButton, SIWE login flow, derivedKeypair→vaultKeypair rename, signatureKeyDerivation.ts deleted |
| 12.3-04 | LinkedMethods UI (385 lines) — view/link/unlink all auth types with SIWE wallet linking |

**Human testing recommended:** MetaMask wallet login, wallet linking from settings, cross-method vault consistency
