Committed: `docs(12.6): capture phase context`

Created: `.planning/phases/12.6-per-file-ipns-metadata-split/12.6-CONTEXT.md`

## Decisions Captured

### TEE Republish Scaling
- Priority-based degradation, backend orchestrates, TEE stays dumb
- Enroll at upload, note drift risk for future

### Migration Approach
- Clean break (v2-only), desktop deferred

### File Metadata Boundaries
- Timestamps in both places, size/mimeType in file record only
- No versionHistory field (Phase 13 adds it cheaply)

### Batch Publish API
- Single API call, backend retries internally, TEE enrollment in same call

## Noted for Later
- Dedicated single-file publish endpoint — Phase 14
- TEE enrollment drift reconciliation — if drift appears
- Desktop FUSE client v2 support — follow-up task

## Next Up
