API health is green — database is up. 

Here's what I can test without auth:
- Login page rendering (done)
- API connectivity (done)
- Footer links, staging banner

For post-auth testing (file browser, vault init, sync, user menu hover fix), we need to log in. How do you want to handle it? Options:

1. **You drive auth** — I'll click the buttons, you handle the Google/wallet popup interaction, then I take over once we're in the file browser
2. **Email OTP** — if the test account (`test_account_4718@example.com` / `851527`) is configured on staging, I can automate the full flow

Which approach?
