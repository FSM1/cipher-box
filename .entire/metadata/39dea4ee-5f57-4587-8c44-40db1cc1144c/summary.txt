Good — that confirms the diagnosis. The sync error only happened because there was no IPNS record yet. Once you uploaded (which publishes an IPNS record), subsequent syncs resolve fine.

The fix I just made handles this properly: when `resolveIpnsRecord` returns `null` (record doesn't exist), we return normally instead of throwing, so `useSyncPolling` marks initial sync complete and shows the empty file browser. This covers the re-login-to-empty-vault case.

Want me to commit this with the other fixes and push?
