Good. Here's the summary of the two fixes:

**Fix 1 — Double signing race condition** (`WalletLoginButton.tsx`):
- Removed the direct `handleSiweFlow()` call from `handleConnectorClick`. Now only the `useEffect` triggers SIWE after wagmi updates `isConnected`/`address`. Previously both the effect and the callback called it, racing each other with different nonces.

**Fix 2 — Wagmi error on mount** (`config.ts`):
- Added `reconnectOnMount: false` to the wagmi config. Since CipherBox disconnects immediately after SIWE signing, there's no reason for wagmi to try reconnecting to a stale connector on page load — that was causing errors especially in Brave.
