Dropdown stayed open while hovering over [settings] — the `::before` bridge fix is working. All 4 fixes from PR #137 verified on staging:

| Fix | Status |
|-----|--------|
| Google OAuth (Brave fallback to iframe button) | Working |
| Empty vault sync (no "sync failed" on fresh account) | Working — shows "Synced" checkmark |
| User menu hover gap | Working — dropdown stays open moving to items |
| CoreKit + TSS key export | Working — logs show clean login flow |

Want me to test anything else? I could try creating a folder or uploading a file to verify the full vault write → IPNS publish flow.
