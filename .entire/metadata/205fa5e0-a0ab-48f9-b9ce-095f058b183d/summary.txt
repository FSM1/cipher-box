Committed: `docs(13): capture phase context`

---

Created: `.planning/phases/13-file-versioning/13-CONTEXT.md`

## Decisions Captured

### Version Encryption Keys
- New key per version, stored in `FileMetadata.versions[]` array

### Version History UI
- Past versions only (current not listed)
- Claude's discretion on layout and info density

### Restore Behavior
- Non-destructive: restore creates new version, current becomes past
- Confirmation dialog required, web-only

### Retention & Pruning
- 10 versions max, auto-prune oldest silently
- Manual delete of specific versions supported
- Counts against 500 MiB quota

### Version Creation Triggers
- All content changes version, 15-min cooldown for FUSE/editor saves
- Web re-upload always versions (no cooldown)
