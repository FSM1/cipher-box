All 6 review threads addressed, replied to, and resolved:

| # | Comment | Fix |
|---|---------|-----|
| 1 | Stale parser header comment | Updated to document all 5 fields + all-or-nothing behavior |
| 2 | Controller branch coverage / partial spreads | Single `hasSigData` check, all-or-nothing bundle |
| 3 | Parser silent pubKey failure | Parser drops all sig fields if any is missing |
| 4 | Service returns unverifiable partial data | Fixed at parser level — upstream fix benefits all consumers |
| 5 | Unrelated `.claude/settings.json` | Acknowledged, kept since harmless dev tooling |
| 6 | Silent skip when sig data missing | Intentional for DB-cache fallback; documented trust boundary |

PR #88 is ready for re-review.
