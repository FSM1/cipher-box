Looks clean. The `build-desktop` job (lines 116-159) runs in parallel with the other build jobs, and `deploy-vps` (line 163) still only depends on `[build-api, build-tee, build-web]`.

**Quick Task 017:** Add desktop binary build to staging release workflow

**What was added to `deploy-staging.yml`:**
- New `build-desktop` job on `macos-latest` runner
- Installs macFUSE headers for fuser compilation
- Builds `@cipherbox/crypto` workspace dep, then runs `tauri-apps/tauri-action@v0`
- Bakes staging VITE_* env vars into the binary
- Uploads `.dmg` to a GitHub pre-release for the staging tag
- Runs fully in parallel — desktop build failure cannot block VPS deploy

**Commits:** `8351fd2` (workflow), `f472bf8` (plan/summary), `513b8fc` (STATE.md)

Ready to push when you want to test it with a staging tag.
