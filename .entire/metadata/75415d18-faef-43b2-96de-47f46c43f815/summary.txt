PR created: https://github.com/FSM1/cipher-box/pull/134

Here's a summary of what was done:

**Problems found:**
1. Only **"Build"** was a required status check — Lint, Test, API Spec, E2E, PR Title were all optional
2. E2E had `continue-on-error: true` (leftover from Phases 12.3.1/12.4)
3. No type-checking step existed at all

**Fixes applied:**

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| New `typecheck` job | Runs `tsc --noEmit` on crypto + `tsc -b` on web |
| CI dependency chain | lint + typecheck (parallel) -> test -> build |
| E2E blocking | Removed `continue-on-error: true` |
| Branch protection | Now requires **all 7 checks**: Lint, Typecheck, Verify API Spec & Client, Test, Build, E2E Tests, lint-pr-title |
| Strict mode | `strict: true` — PR branch must be up-to-date with main |

The branch protection update is already live on GitHub (applied via API), so PR #133 (Phase 12.6) will now also be blocked until all checks pass.
