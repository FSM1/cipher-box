ok there are a bunch of comments from coderabbit on the pr, probably some test coverage failures, and some failing e2e tests.

also for some reason, it was possible to merge the PR with failing test coverage (or tests, I didnt check).

Could you please check on the branch protection rules, and ensure that all the CI jobs are required, not just the build. I think this needs to be made in to a logical CI pipeline of lint-check -> type-check -> build -> test -> e2e with a failure at any step causing the entire pipeline to fail. 

any step that is not passed should block the pr from being merged.
