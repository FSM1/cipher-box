Looks good. All three CodeRabbit review comments are addressed:

1. **Batching strategy** (line 35): Explicitly states per-file IPNS records MUST be published together in batch operations, not individually — preserving the Phase 07.1 pattern.

2. **TEE republisher scalability** (lines 40-44): Expanded from the vague "many more keys to manage" to concrete analysis — scale impact (21x example), capacity limits, parallelization requirements, and fallback plan.

3. **External reference removed** (lines 48-62): Replaced the dangling Perplexity reference with a version-controlled "Full specification" section that outlines exactly what needs to be inlined, with a TODO marker for when this gets picked up for implementation.
