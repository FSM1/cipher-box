Done. Fixed both nitpicks in `310d22b`:

1. **Google email normalization**: `googlePayload.email` is now `.toLowerCase().trim()` before being used as `identifierDisplay` and in JWT signing — consistent with the email-OTP path
2. **Deduplicated wallet user creation**: Removed `findOrCreateUserByWallet` (~40 lines), widened `findOrCreateUserByIdentifier` to accept `'wallet'` type, caller passes truncated address as display. Also fixed the stale JSDoc referencing the old `findOrCreateUserByEmail` name.
