Pushed. Here's what was wrong:

1. **`ipns.service.spec.ts`** — `publishRecord` now passes `recordType: 'folder'` to `create()`, test expectation was missing it
2. **`republish.service.spec.ts`** — `BATCH_SIZE` changed from 50→100 and `getDueEntries` `take` from 500→2000, but the test still used the old values (60 entries expecting 2 batches, when 60 < 100 means 1 batch). Updated to 150 entries (2 batches of 100+50)
3. **`full-workflow.spec.ts`** — E2E file details test expected v1 inline fields (Size, Content CID, Encryption Mode, File IV, Wrapped File Key) but v2 FilePointer shows different fields (File Metadata IPNS, Metadata CID). Updated assertions to match
