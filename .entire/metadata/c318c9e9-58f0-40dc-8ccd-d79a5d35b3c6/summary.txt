The fix is simple and correct. Here's the root cause:

**Problem:** The CI workflow installed `macfuse` (which provides macFUSE headers/libraries like `libosxfuse`), but the project uses **FUSE-T** — the vendored fuser's pkg-config is configured via `.cargo/config.toml` to use a custom `fuse.pc` that links against `-lfuse-t`. The macFUSE installation doesn't provide `libfuse-t`, so the linker fails.

**Fix:** Replace `brew install --cask macfuse` with `brew install --cask fuse-t`, which installs the actual FUSE-T library (`libfuse-t.dylib` and `libfuse-t.a`) at `/usr/local/lib/` along with compatible headers at `/usr/local/include/fuse/`.
