Once this PR's E2E tests pass and it merges to main, the release PR #165 should be unblocked. The fix addresses the root cause: when subfolder loading fails, the app now navigates back to the parent folder instead of leaving the user stranded on a broken `/files/<uuid>` URL with an empty directory.
