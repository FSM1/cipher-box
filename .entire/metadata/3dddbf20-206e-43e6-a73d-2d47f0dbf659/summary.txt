Pushed. The fix addresses the exact failure mode: after the first `navigateTo` fails, `setIsLoading(false)` was never called because `latestNavTarget.current` was already changed to the parent ID before the `finally` block ran. This left the "Loading..." overlay permanently visible, hiding the file list and preventing the retry from finding the folder row.

Now the flow should be:
1. Double-click images → `navigateTo` fails → catch: `removeFolder` + `setIsLoading(false)` + navigate to workspace
2. Workspace renders children (including images folder row)
3. Retry: `waitForItemToAppear('images-...')` succeeds → double-click images again → second attempt loads successfully
