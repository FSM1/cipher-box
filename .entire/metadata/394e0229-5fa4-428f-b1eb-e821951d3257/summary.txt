All checks pass, including E2E Tests.

**Summary of changes:**

1. **ARIA tab keyboard navigation** (SettingsPage.tsx) — Added roving tabindex and ArrowLeft/ArrowRight/Home/End keyboard handlers to the settings tabs per WAI-ARIA authoring practices.

2. **Update viem** (tests/e2e/package.json) — Bumped from `^2.44.4` to `^2.46.1`.

3. **Wait for visibility before click** (login.page.ts) — Added `waitFor({ state: 'visible' })` in `cancelWalletLogin()` to match the pattern used in other click methods.

4. **Fix E2E test failure** — Renamed `derivedKeypair` → `vaultKeypair` in the E2E auth helper (field was renamed in Phase 12.3 but the test helper wasn't updated). Also moved `setCreateFolderDialogOpen(false)` to a `finally` block so the dialog always closes even on error.
