## Current Focus

hypothesis: CORS blocks fetch from webview (origin localhost:1420) to API (localhost:3000)
test: Add <http://localhost:1420> to CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS + add JS error reporting to Rust
expecting: Fetch succeeds, handle_test_login_complete called, mount appears
next_action: Push round 5 fixes, trigger CI
ci_run: pending (round 5)

## Symptoms

expected: All desktop E2E tests pass on macOS, Linux, and Windows in CI
actual: All three platforms fail — JS runs, get_dev_key succeeds, but auth flow fails silently
reproduction: workflow_dispatch on fix/desktop-e2e-ci-round3

## Timeline

### Round 1 — CI run 22535471201 (main branch)

- Windows: Kubo download fails (PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest IOException)
- macOS: dyld error — Library not loaded: @rpath/libfuse-t.dylib
- Linux: Mount not detected after 90s

### Round 2 — CI run 22536010865 (fix/desktop-e2e-ci-round3, commit 10deba393)

Applied fixes: frontend build before cargo, rpath fix, bash+curl for Kubo, WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER

- ✅ macOS: rpath FIXED, binary starts without crash
- ✅ Kubo download FIXED on all platforms
- ❌ macOS+Linux: Binary starts, webview created, but mount never appears (no Rust log after setup)
- ❌ Windows: redis-server not found after choco install (PATH not refreshed)

### Round 3 — CI run 22536256440 (commit 5d3ce6e26)

Applied fixes: diagnostic logging (on_page_load, get_dev_key logging, RUST_LOG=debug, pre-flight checks, Redis PATH fix)

- 🔍 **SMOKING GUN FOUND**: Webview page load logged `url=http://localhost:1420/`
  - Debug builds use `devUrl` not `frontendDist`!
  - No Vite dev server running → empty page → JS never runs → no auth → no mount
- `get_dev_key` never called (confirms JS not executing)
- Pre-flight: API health check passed

### Round 4 — CI run 22536393479 (commits a236637e7, 928918a47)

Applied fixes: Vite preview server on :1420, Memurai for Windows Redis

- ✅ macOS: Page loads! JS executes! `get_dev_key` called and returned `has_key=true`!
- ✅ Linux: Same — page loaded, JS executed, `get_dev_key` returned `has_key=true`
- ❌ macOS+Linux: After `get_dev_key` returns, NO more Rust logs for 90s → mount timeout
  - `handle_test_login_complete` never called
  - JS enters `handleDevKeyAuth()` → `fetch(localhost:3000/auth/test-login)` → **silently fails**
  - Error caught by `catch(err)` → logged to `console.error` → INVISIBLE (no way to see webview console)
- ❌ Windows: Memurai fix not tested yet (pushed after round 4 triggered)

**Root cause of round 4 failure**: CORS! The API's `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is `http://localhost:5173`.
The webview loads from `http://localhost:1420`. The cross-origin fetch to `http://localhost:3000`
is blocked because the API doesn't include `:1420` in its allowed origins.

### Round 5 — CI run pending

Applied fixes:

- Add `http://localhost:1420` to `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (API .env, macOS/Linux env, Windows env)
- Add `log_js_error` Tauri command so JS errors are visible in Rust logs
- Add step-by-step logging inside `handleDevKeyAuth()` (logStep calls)
- Add error reporting in catch handler (calls `log_js_error` instead of just `console.error`)

## Eliminated

- hypothesis: xvfb-action splitting commands
  evidence: Fixed in earlier commits (dbc4e3d44), replaced with manual Xvfb

- hypothesis: Missing rpath for FUSE-T dylib (macOS)
  evidence: FIXED. install_name_tool -add_rpath /usr/local/lib works. CI logs show LC_RPATH.

- hypothesis: PowerShell Kubo download unreliable (Windows)
  evidence: FIXED. bash+curl with --retry works reliably.

- hypothesis: Missing frontend build
  evidence: PARTIALLY relevant. Frontend IS built, but debug binary doesn't embed it.
  The real issue is that debug builds use devUrl not frontendDist.

- hypothesis: WebKitGTK DMA-BUF renderer (Linux)
  evidence: Not the cause. WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 added but mount still failed.

- hypothesis: WASM import failure in auth.ts
  evidence: Not the cause (yet). JS loads and get_dev_key runs. handleDevKeyAuth starts
  but fetch fails — likely CORS, not WASM.

- hypothesis: Debug binary uses devUrl not frontendDist
  evidence: CONFIRMED AND FIXED in round 4 with vite preview on :1420. JS now runs.

## Root Causes (layered)

### Root Cause 1 (fixed round 4): Debug builds use devUrl

**Tauri debug builds use `devUrl` (<http://localhost:1420>), not embedded `frontendDist`.**

Fix: Start `vite preview --port 1420` before the binary.

### Root Cause 2 (fixing round 5): CORS blocks auth flow

The webview's origin is `http://localhost:1420`. The API's `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` only includes
`http://localhost:5173`. The `fetch()` to `http://localhost:3000/auth/test-login` is a cross-origin
request that gets blocked by CORS policy. The error is caught silently by the JS try-catch.

Fix: Add `http://localhost:1420` to `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in all 3 places in the CI workflow.

### Round 5 Results — CI run 22536602620 (commit 1271df5ff)

CORS fix WORKED! Auth flow completes on macOS AND Linux!

- ✅ macOS: JS auth flow logged all steps — fetch status=200, handle_test_login_complete done
- ✅ macOS: FUSE mount detected! All 9 FUSE I/O tests PASSED!
- ✅ Linux: Same — mount detected, all 9 FUSE I/O tests PASSED!
- ❌ macOS+Linux: API round-trip Test 2 FAIL — "Vault has no rootIpnsName after 60s polling"
  - Root cause: test-round-trip.sh creates a NEW random user email, not <dev-key@cipherbox.local>
  - The FUSE mount belongs to <dev-key@cipherbox.local>, but the test checks a different user's vault
  - Fix: change TEST_EMAIL to <dev-key@cipherbox.local>
- ❌ Windows: still in progress (cargo build is slow on Windows runners)

### Round 6 — CI run pending

Applied fix:

- Change TEST_EMAIL in test-round-trip.sh and test-round-trip.ps1 to <dev-key@cipherbox.local>

## Open Questions

1. Will the correct test email fix the API round-trip tests?
2. Windows: will Memurai + CORS + correct email work together?
3. Can we remove diagnostic logging (log_js_error, on_page_load) after CI passes?
