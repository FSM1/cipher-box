<objective>
Clean up stale comments about skipped E2E move tests and verify the move tests are present and structurally sound.

Purpose: The original audit flagged "skipped E2E move tests" but investigation reveals the move tests (4.1-4.3) are actually present as regular `test()` calls. The issue is stale comments from a time when they were skipped, which create confusion. Clean these up and confirm test structure is correct.

Output: Clean E2E test file with accurate comments, no misleading references to skipped tests.

  <name>Task 1: Remove stale skip comments and verify move test structure</name>
  <files>tests/e2e/tests/full-workflow.spec.ts</files>
  <action>
The E2E move tests (tests 4.1, 4.2, 4.3) ARE present and NOT skipped — they are regular `test()` calls in the "Phase 4: Move Files Between Folders" section. However, there are stale comments that incorrectly claim they are skipped.

REMOVE the stale comment at approximately line 68:

```ts
// NOTE: getCurrentFolderName() was removed since move tests (Phase 4) are skipped
```

This is inaccurate — the move tests are present. The `getCurrentFolderName()` function was removed because it's not needed, not because tests were skipped.

REMOVE the stale comment block at approximately lines 260-261:

```ts
// NOTE: getTrackedFolderId() was removed since move tests (Phase 4) are
// skipped. Re-add when move functionality is implemented via context menu
// or drag-drop to folder rows.
```

Move functionality IS implemented via context menu (tests 4.1, 4.2 use it) and drag-drop to breadcrumb (test 4.3). This comment is entirely stale.

Verify the move test section (Phase 4, tests 4.1-4.3) has correct structure:

- test 4.1: "Move file via context menu" — uses rightClickItem, clickMove, MoveDialog, selectFolder, clickMove
- test 4.2: "Move file via drag-drop to folder row" — actually uses context menu + MoveDialog (not drag-drop despite the name)
- test 4.3: "Move file via drag-drop to breadcrumb" — uses dragItemToBreadcrumb

Fix the misleading test name for test 4.2. The test is named "Move file via drag-drop to folder row" but actually uses context menu + MoveDialog (same mechanism as 4.1, just moving between sibling folders). Rename to: `'4.2 Move file between sibling folders via context menu'`

Verify no other stale comments reference "skipped" move tests anywhere in the E2E codebase. Search `tests/e2e/` for mentions of "skip" related to moves.
</action>
<verify>
Run `grep -n "skipped\|skip" tests/e2e/tests/full-workflow.spec.ts` — should return 0 lines (no references to skipped tests remain).
Run `grep -c "test\('4\." tests/e2e/tests/full-workflow.spec.ts` — should return 4 (tests 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4).
</verify>
<done>
Stale "skipped" comments removed. Test 4.2 renamed to accurately describe its behavior. Move tests 4.1-4.3 confirmed present and structurally sound. No misleading references to skipped tests remain in E2E codebase.
</done>
</task>

<verification>

1. No "skipped" or "skip" references in full-workflow.spec.ts
2. Move tests 4.1-4.3 are present as regular `test()` calls (not `test.skip()`)
3. Test names accurately describe what each test does
4. E2E test file has consistent, accurate comments throughout

</verification>

<success_criteria>

- Zero stale comments about skipped move tests
- All 4 Phase 4 E2E tests (4.1-4.4) present as regular test() calls
- Test 4.2 has accurate name reflecting its actual behavior
- No grep hits for "skip" in full-workflow.spec.ts

</success_criteria>
