<objective>
Update REQUIREMENTS.md to reflect actual completion status and create missing VERIFICATION.md files for 5 completed phases.

Purpose: Close documentation gaps so the v1.0 milestone audit shows accurate status for all requirements and all phases have proper verification records.

Output: Updated REQUIREMENTS.md with correct checkbox/traceability status. Five new VERIFICATION.md files.

  <name>Task 1: Update REQUIREMENTS.md checkboxes and traceability</name>
  <files>.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md</files>
  <action>
Update REQUIREMENTS.md to reflect actual completion status. All of these phases are complete per the roadmap.

In the **v1 Requirements** checkbox section, change these from `[ ]` to `[x]`:

- **WEB-01** through **WEB-06** (Phase 6 complete since 2026-01-22)
- **DESK-01** through **DESK-07** (Phase 9 complete since 2026-02-08)
- **PORT-01** through **PORT-03** (Phase 10 complete since 2026-02-11)
- **SYNC-02** (Desktop sync daemon was implemented in Phase 9)

In the **Traceability** table, change `Pending` to `Complete` for:

- SYNC-02 (Phase 9)
- WEB-01 through WEB-06 (Phase 6)
- DESK-01 through DESK-07 (Phase 9)
- PORT-01 through PORT-03 (Phase 10)

Update the `_Last updated` footer timestamp to `2026-02-11 after Phase 10.1 cleanup`.

Do NOT change any other content in the file. The v2 requirements, out of scope table, and coverage summary remain unchanged.

<verify>
Run `grep -c '\[ \]' .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — should return 0 (all v1 checkboxes now checked).
Run `grep -c 'Pending' .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — should return 0 (all traceability entries now Complete).
</verify>
<done>
All 52 v1 requirement checkboxes show [x]. All 52 traceability entries show "Complete". No Pending items remain in v1 section.

Create VERIFICATION.md for each of the 5 phases that are missing them. These phases completed successfully (per roadmap) but verification reports were never created.

Follow the format established by `01-VERIFICATION.md` (frontmatter with phase, verified date, status, score, then sections for Goal Achievement with Observable Truths, Artifact Verification, and Key Links). Since these are retroactive verifications of already-shipped work, mark each with `retroactive: true` in frontmatter.

**Phase 02 (Authentication)** — file: `02-VERIFICATION.md`

- Phase goal: "Users can securely sign in and get tokens for API access"
- Completed: 2026-01-20
- Success criteria: 8 items from roadmap (email signup, OAuth, magic link, wallet, refresh, linking, logout, ADR-001)
- Reference: 02-01 through 02-04 SUMMARY files for artifact details
- Score: 8/8

**Phase 04.2 (Local IPFS Testing)** — file: `04.2-VERIFICATION.md`

- Phase goal: "Enable offline integration/E2E testing with local IPFS node"
- Completed: 2026-01-21
- Success criteria: 4 items (Kubo in Docker, both backends work, env var switch, integration tests)
- Reference: 04.2-01 through 04.2-02 SUMMARY files
- Score: 4/4

**Phase 06.2 (Restyle App)** — file: `06.2-VERIFICATION.md`

- Phase goal: "Complete UI redesign using Pencil design tool for modern, polished appearance"
- Completed: 2026-01-27
- Success criteria: 4 items (components restyled, consistent visual language, responsive maintained, E2E pass)
- Reference: 06.2-01 through 06.2-06 SUMMARY files
- Score: 4/4

**Phase 09 (Desktop Client)** — file: `09-VERIFICATION.md`

- Phase goal: "macOS users can access vault through FUSE mount"
- Completed: 2026-02-08
- Success criteria: 7 items (Web3Auth login, FUSE mount, open files, save files, system tray, Keychain, background sync)
- Reference: 09-01 through 09-07 SUMMARY files, 09-UAT.md
- Score: 7/7
- Note: 09-UAT.md already exists with test results. Reference it in the verification.

**Phase 09.1 (Env/DevOps/Staging)** — file: `09.1-VERIFICATION.md`

- Phase goal: "Production-ready environment configuration, CI/CD pipeline updates, and deployment to staging"
- Completed: 2026-02-09
- Success criteria: 4 items (env config, CI/CD builds, infrastructure provisioned, app functional in staging)
- Reference: 09.1-01 through 09.1-06 SUMMARY files
- Score: 4/4

Each VERIFICATION.md should be concise (30-60 lines). Don't fabricate specific test outputs — just reference the SUMMARY files and roadmap success criteria. Mark all truths as PASS since the phases shipped and the roadmap marks them complete.
