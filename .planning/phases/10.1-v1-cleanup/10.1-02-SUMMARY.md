# Phase 10.1 Plan 02: Documentation Cleanup Summary

**Updated all 52 v1 requirement checkboxes to [x], cleared 17 Pending traceability entries, and created 5 retroactive VERIFICATION.md files for phases 02, 04.2, 06.2, 09, 09.1**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-11T03:14:47Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-11T03:17:48Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 6

## Accomplishments

- All 52 v1 requirement checkboxes in REQUIREMENTS.md now show [x]
- All 52 traceability entries now show "Complete" (17 were Pending)
- Every completed phase in the project now has a VERIFICATION.md file (16 total)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Update REQUIREMENTS.md checkboxes and traceability** - `a9fff6f` (docs)
2. **Task 2: Create missing VERIFICATION.md files for 5 phases** - `3c7682d` (docs)

## Files Created/Modified

- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` - Updated 17 checkboxes to [x], 17 traceability entries to Complete, footer timestamp
- `.planning/phases/02-authentication/02-VERIFICATION.md` - Retroactive verification (8/8 criteria, completed 2026-01-20)
- `.planning/phases/04.2-local-ipfs-testing/04.2-VERIFICATION.md` - Retroactive verification (4/4 criteria, completed 2026-01-21)
- `.planning/phases/06.2-restyle-app-with-pencil-design/06.2-VERIFICATION.md` - Retroactive verification (4/4 criteria, completed 2026-01-27)
- `.planning/phases/09-desktop-client/09-VERIFICATION.md` - Retroactive verification (7/7 criteria, completed 2026-02-08)
- `.planning/phases/09.1-env-devops-staging/09.1-VERIFICATION.md` - Retroactive verification (4/4 criteria, completed 2026-02-09)

## Decisions Made

- Retroactive verification files marked with `retroactive: true` in frontmatter to distinguish from real-time verifications
- Phase 02-04 summary file was missing but plan was completed per roadmap; noted in verification rather than fabricating a summary

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Documentation gaps closed; all v1 requirements verified and traceable
- Ready for 10.1-03 (E2E test restoration)
