| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Deprecated components removed (FolderTree, FolderTreeNode, ApiStatusIndicator) | VERIFIED | Files deleted, zero grep hits across apps/web/src and tests/e2e for these names. Barrel exports in file-browser/index.ts and page-objects/index.ts are clean. Dashboard.tsx and dashboard.page.ts also deleted.                                                                                          |
| 2   | Unused code removed (addUsage method, /ipfs/add endpoint)                      | VERIFIED | addUsage: zero grep hits in apps/web/src. /ipfs/add: removed from ipfs.controller.ts (only upload, unpin, get remain), add.dto.ts deleted, zero grep hits for AddResponseDto/ipfsControllerAdd in api client and API source. openapi.json has no /ipfs/add path.                                         |
| 3   | REQUIREMENTS.md checkboxes updated to reflect actual completion status         | VERIFIED | Zero unchecked boxes (0 `[ ]` occurrences). Zero Pending traceability entries. 58 `[x]` checkboxes and 58 Complete entries confirmed. WEB-01, DESK-01, PORT-01, SYNC-02 all spot-checked as [x].                                                                                                         |
| 4   | Missing VERIFICATION.md files created for 5 phases (02, 04.2, 06.2, 09, 09.1)  | VERIFIED | All 5 files exist with status: passed and retroactive: true. File sizes: 02 (54 lines), 04.2 (40 lines), 06.2 (44 lines), 09 (59 lines), 09.1 (44 lines). All have proper frontmatter, observable truths tables, and plan references.                                                                    |
| 5   | Skipped E2E move tests investigated and restored or formally removed           | VERIFIED | Tests 4.1-4.4 confirmed as regular test() calls (not test.skip). Zero grep hits for "skip" or "skipped" in full-workflow.spec.ts. Stale comments about skipped tests removed. Test 4.2 renamed to accurately describe context menu behavior. MoveDialogPage properly imported and used in tests 4.1-4.3. |

**Score:** 5/5 truths verified

### Human Verification Required

None. All success criteria are structurally verifiable.

### Gaps Summary

No gaps found. All 5 success criteria from the ROADMAP are fully verified against the actual codebase:

1. All deprecated components (FolderTree, FolderTreeNode, ApiStatusIndicator, Dashboard) are deleted with zero remaining references.
2. All unused code (addUsage method, /ipfs/add endpoint with its DTO, generated client types, and test blocks) is removed.
3. REQUIREMENTS.md has zero unchecked v1 boxes and zero Pending traceability entries.
4. All 5 missing VERIFICATION.md files exist with proper structure and metadata.
5. E2E move tests are confirmed present, not skipped, with stale comments removed and test 4.2 accurately renamed.
