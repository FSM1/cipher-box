# Phase 10.1 Plan 03: E2E Move Test Cleanup Summary

> Removed stale skip comments from E2E tests and fixed misleading test name for move operation test 4.2

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-11T03:14:44Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-11T03:15:39Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Removed 2 stale comments falsely claiming move tests (Phase 4) were skipped
- Renamed test 4.2 to accurately reflect its context menu behavior (was misleadingly named "drag-drop to folder row")
- Confirmed all 4 Phase 4 tests (4.1-4.4) are present as regular `test()` calls, not `test.skip()`
- Verified zero remaining "skip" references in full-workflow.spec.ts

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Remove stale skip comments and verify move test structure** - `933c68f` (fix)

**Plan metadata:** [pending]

## Files Created/Modified

- `tests/e2e/tests/full-workflow.spec.ts` - Removed 2 stale comments about skipped move tests, renamed test 4.2 for accuracy

## Decisions Made

- Renamed test 4.2 from "Move file via drag-drop to folder row" to "Move file between sibling folders via context menu" because the test implementation uses rightClick + context menu + MoveDialog, not drag-drop

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Phase 10.1 cleanup complete (all 3 plans done)
- E2E test suite is clean with accurate comments and test names
- Ready for Phase 10 (Final Integration) or Phase 11 (Launch)
