<objective>
Verify staging infrastructure setup and trigger the first deployment.

Purpose: Plans 01-04 created all the code and configuration. This plan is where the user provisions the actual infrastructure (VPS, DNS, secrets) and verifies the deployment pipeline works end-to-end.

Output: A working staging environment accessible via the configured domain.

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
<action>Provision staging infrastructure and configure secrets</action>
<instructions>

The deployment pipeline is ready but needs real infrastructure. Complete these setup steps:

VPS Setup (Hostinger): Provision a VPS with minimum 4GB RAM / 2 vCPU. Install Docker and Docker Compose v2:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

Create the deployment directory:

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/cipherbox/certs
```

Generate an SSH keypair for CI access:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ci-deploy-key -N ""
# Add ci-deploy-key.pub to /root/.ssh/authorized_keys on VPS
# Save ci-deploy-key (private) for GitHub Secrets
```

Cloudflare DNS Setup: Add DNS records for cipherbox.cc (replace VPS_IP with your VPS IP). A record: api.staging -> VPS_IP (Proxied, orange cloud). CNAME record: app.staging -> cloudflare-ipfs.com (Proxied). TXT record: \_dnslink.app.staging -> dnslink=/ipfs/placeholder (DNS only, gray cloud). Note: IPFS and TEE worker do NOT need external DNS records -- the browser fetches files through the API, and the TEE worker is only called internally.

Set SSL/TLS to Full (Strict). Generate Origin CA certificate (SSL/TLS -> Origin Server -> Create Certificate, RSA 2048, 15-year). Save origin.pem and origin-key.pem, then upload to VPS:

```bash
scp origin.pem origin-key.pem root@VPS_IP:/opt/cipherbox/certs/
```

Note your Zone ID and the DNSLink TXT record ID.

Pinata Setup: Ensure your Pinata account has API access. Generate a JWT token (Dashboard -> API Keys -> New Key with pinFileToIPFS + pinList permissions). Save the JWT for GitHub Secrets.

Grafana Cloud Setup: Sign up at grafana.com/products/cloud (free tier). Create a stack. Note the Loki push URL, username, and generate an API key.

Better Stack Setup: Sign up at betterstack.com/uptime (free tier). Create a monitor for `https://api.staging.cipherbox.cc/health` with 3-minute interval. Configure email alerts.

GitHub Secrets: Go to repository Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions. Add these repository secrets: STAGING_HOST (VPS IP), STAGING_USER (SSH username), STAGING_SSH_KEY (CI SSH private key), STAGING_DB_USERNAME, STAGING_DB_PASSWORD (openssl rand -hex 32), STAGING_JWT_SECRET (openssl rand -hex 32), STAGING_TEE_WORKER_SECRET (openssl rand -hex 32), STAGING_API_URL (e.g., <https://api.yourdomain.com>), STAGING_WEB_APP_URL (e.g., <https://app.yourdomain.com>), STAGING_PINATA_GATEWAY_URL (<https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs>), PINATA_JWT, CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN (DNS edit permission), CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID, CLOUDFLARE_DNSLINK_RECORD_ID, VITE_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID (may already exist), GRAFANA_LOKI_URL, GRAFANA_LOKI_USERNAME, GRAFANA_LOKI_API_KEY.

Copy Docker Compose to VPS:

```bash
scp docker/docker-compose.staging.yml root@VPS_IP:/opt/cipherbox/docker-compose.staging.yml
scp docker/Caddyfile root@VPS_IP:/opt/cipherbox/Caddyfile
```

</instructions>
<resume-signal>Type "infrastructure ready" when all setup is complete</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="auto">
<name>Task 2: Trigger first deployment and verify</name>
<files></files>
<action>

After the user confirms infrastructure is ready:

1. Create and push the first staging tag:

```bash
git tag v0.1.0-staging.1
git push origin v0.1.0-staging.1
```

2. Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow:

```bash
gh run list --workflow=deploy-staging.yml --limit=1
gh run watch
```

3. If the workflow fails, read the logs, diagnose the issue, and fix:

```bash
gh run view --log-failed
```

Common issues: Docker build failures (fix Dockerfile or .dockerignore), SSH connection refused (verify SSH key and VPS IP in secrets), Pinata upload failure (verify PINATA_JWT), Cloudflare API error (verify API token permissions and zone ID), migration failure (database may need initial connection, or migration command path may be wrong inside the container -- check container WORKDIR and available binaries).

4. If the workflow succeeds, verify the staging environment by checking API health endpoint, web app loading, and Swagger docs.

</action>
<verify>

1. GitHub Actions workflow completes successfully
2. API health endpoint returns 200 on staging domain
3. Web app is accessible at staging domain

</verify>
<done>
First deployment tag triggers successful pipeline run. API responds on staging domain. Web app loads from IPFS via Cloudflare.
</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
<what-built>Complete staging deployment: API on VPS behind Caddy/Cloudflare, web app on IPFS via Pinata/Cloudflare, TEE worker running alongside API</what-built>
<how-to-verify>

1. Open the staging web app URL in a browser -- the CipherBox login page should load
2. Open the staging API URL /health -- should return health status JSON
3. Open the staging API URL /api-docs -- Swagger UI should load
4. Try logging in via Web3Auth on the staging web app
5. Check Docker containers on VPS via SSH -- should show 6 containers running
6. Check Better Stack dashboard -- monitor should show API as "up"

</how-to-verify>
<resume-signal>Type "approved" if staging works, or describe issues</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>

- GitHub Actions deploy-staging workflow completed successfully
- API responds at staging domain /health endpoint
- Web app loads at staging domain
- Docker containers running on VPS
- Better Stack shows API health monitor as "up"

</verification>

<success_criteria>
Staging environment is live: web app accessible via IPFS/Cloudflare, API accessible via VPS/Caddy/Cloudflare, all services running in Docker. The deployment pipeline works end-to-end from tag push to live environment. Better Stack monitors the API health endpoint externally.
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/09.1-env-devops-staging/09.1-05-SUMMARY.md`
