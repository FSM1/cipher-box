# Phase 12.5 Plan 01: Wire SecurityTab into SettingsPage Summary

ARIA tabbed navigation (LINKED METHODS | SECURITY) merged into SettingsPage.tsx, resolving ISSUE-004 that left SecurityTab orphaned and unreachable.

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-16T20:17:44Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-16T20:19:22Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files modified:** 2 (1 modified, 1 deleted)

## Accomplishments

- Merged tabbed ARIA UI from orphaned Settings.tsx into SettingsPage.tsx
- SecurityTab now accessible via SECURITY tab in settings page, unblocking MFA UAT (TC25-31)
- VaultExport preserved as always-visible section below tab panels
- Deleted orphaned Settings.tsx that was never routed to

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Merge Settings.tsx tab UI into SettingsPage.tsx and remove orphan** - `9c5ec8dcb` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `apps/web/src/routes/SettingsPage.tsx` - Added useState, SecurityTab import, ARIA tablist/tab/tabpanel structure with LINKED METHODS and SECURITY tabs
- `apps/web/src/routes/Settings.tsx` - Deleted (orphaned file, never imported)

## Decisions Made

- **VaultExport below tabs, not as a tab:** VaultExport is always visible regardless of active tab since it is a utility action, not a settings category
- **Merge into SettingsPage rather than re-route:** SettingsPage.tsx is the canonical routed component with AppShell wrapper; merging the tab structure preserves the existing routing and layout

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- SecurityTab is now accessible from /settings, unblocking all MFA-related UAT test cases
- LINKED METHODS tab preserves existing auth method management functionality
- Web app builds cleanly with no TypeScript errors
