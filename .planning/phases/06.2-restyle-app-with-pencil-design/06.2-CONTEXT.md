# Phase 6.2: Restyle App with Pencil Design - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-23
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Complete UI redesign of the CipherBox web app using the Pencil design file as the source of truth. This covers login screens, file browser, and all associated components. The restyle maintains existing functionality — no new features, just visual refresh to match the terminal/hacker aesthetic.

## Implementation Decisions

### Design Source
- Primary design file: `designs/cipher-box-design.pen`
- Design covers: Desktop file browser, mobile file browser, login screens (connected/disconnected states)
- For missing elements (error states, loading spinners, empty states): ask Pencil to generate designs
- Settings page: User will design in Pencil first before implementation

### Visual Identity
- **Theme:** Dark mode only — no light mode option
- **Typography:** JetBrains Mono exclusively throughout the entire app
- **Primary color:** Black background (`#000000`)
- **Accent color:** Green (`#00D084`) for borders, highlights, buttons, text
- **Secondary colors:** Add red for errors, yellow for warnings (semantic colors alongside green)
- **Matrix background:** Subtle animation on login if implementation complexity is reasonable, otherwise static

### Component Scope
- Restyle everything at once: login + file browser + modals together
- Modals (upload progress, delete confirmation, rename): Match terminal style (Claude designs)
- Context menus: Terminal style with green borders, mono font, dark background
- Settings page: Deferred until user creates Pencil design

### Design Consistency
- **Fidelity:** Visually equivalent — same feel, but Claude can adjust for responsiveness
- **Terminal prefixes:** Keep [DIR], [FILE], [docs] etc. exactly as designed
- **Hover/focus states:** Subtle green glow effect on interactive elements
- **Missing elements:** Ask Pencil to generate designs rather than improvising

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact responsive breakpoints (design shows 1440px desktop, 390px mobile)
- Animation timing and easing for matrix effect
- Semantic color shades (which red, which yellow)
- Loading spinner design if not provided

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Terminal/hacker aesthetic with binary/hex matrix decoration on login
- Green-on-black color scheme reminiscent of classic terminals
- `> CIPHERBOX` branding with cursor indicator
- File list with `[DIR]` and `[FILE]` type prefixes
- Status bar at bottom showing connection status and hints
- Breadcrumb navigation with terminal-style formatting

### Design File Reference
The .pen file contains these screens:
- `bi8Au` — Desktop file browser (1440x900)
- `ZVAUX` — Mobile file browser (390x844)
- `gVNOQ` — Desktop login connected
- `3OkP2` — Mobile login connected
- `77MPO` — Desktop login disconnected
- `j6TYH` — Mobile login disconnected

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- Settings page restyle — waiting for user to create Pencil design first
- Light mode theme — explicitly out of scope (dark only)

</deferred>
