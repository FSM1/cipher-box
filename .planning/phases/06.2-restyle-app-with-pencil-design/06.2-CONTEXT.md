# Phase 6.2: Restyle App with Pencil Design - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-23
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Complete UI redesign of the CipherBox web app using the Pencil design file as the source of truth. This covers login screens, file browser, and all associated components. The restyle maintains existing functionality — no new features, just visual refresh to match the terminal/hacker aesthetic.

## Implementation Decisions

- **Design Source:** Primary design file is `designs/cipher-box-design.pen`. Design covers desktop file browser, mobile file browser, login screens (connected/disconnected states). For missing elements (error states, loading spinners, empty states): ask Pencil to generate designs. Settings page: User will design in Pencil first before implementation.
- **Visual Identity:** Dark mode only (no light mode). JetBrains Mono typography throughout. Black background (`#000000`). Green accent (`#00D084`) for borders, highlights, buttons, text. Red for errors, yellow for warnings. Full animated matrix rain effect on login.
- **Component Scope:** Restyle everything at once (login + file browser + modals). Modals match terminal style. Context menus: green borders, mono font, dark background. Settings page deferred until user creates Pencil design.
- **Design Consistency:** Visually equivalent feel, but Claude can adjust for responsiveness. Keep [DIR], [FILE], [docs] prefixes exactly as designed. Subtle green glow on hover/focus. Ask Pencil for missing elements rather than improvising.
- **Claude's Discretion:** Exact responsive breakpoints. Animation timing/easing for matrix effect. Semantic color shades. Loading spinner design if not provided.

## Specific Ideas

- Terminal/hacker aesthetic with binary/hex matrix decoration on login
- Green-on-black color scheme reminiscent of classic terminals
- `> CIPHERBOX` branding with cursor indicator
- File list with `[DIR]` and `[FILE]` type prefixes
- Status bar at bottom showing connection status and hints
- Breadcrumb navigation with terminal-style formatting

The .pen file contains these screens: `bi8Au` (Desktop file browser 1440x900), `ZVAUX` (Mobile file browser 390x844), `gVNOQ` (Desktop login connected), `3OkP2` (Mobile login connected), `77MPO` (Desktop login disconnected), `j6TYH` (Mobile login disconnected).

## Deferred Ideas

- Settings page restyle — waiting for user to create Pencil design first
- Light mode theme — explicitly out of scope (dark only)
