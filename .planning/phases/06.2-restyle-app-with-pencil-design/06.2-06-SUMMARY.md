# Phase 06.2 Plan 06: E2E Test Verification Summary

E2E tests verified compatible with terminal aesthetic - no selector updates required.

## Performance

- **Duration:** Verification only
- **Completed:** 2026-01-27
- **Tasks:** Verification
- **Files modified:** 0

## Accomplishments

- Verified E2E page objects use CSS class selectors throughout (stable across visual changes)
- Verified test assertions use regex patterns that handle both old and new text formats
- Confirmed no test selector updates needed for terminal aesthetic compatibility

## Verification Results

### Page Object Selectors (Already Compatible)

1. **LoginPage** - Uses `button.login-button` class selector
2. **DashboardPage** - Uses `.logout-link`, `[data-testid]` selectors
3. **FileListPage** - Uses `.file-list-item`, `.file-list-item-name`, `.file-list-item-size` class selectors
4. **UploadZonePage** - Uses `.upload-zone`, `.upload-zone-error` class selectors
5. **Full workflow tests** - Uses `.file-browser-new-folder-button`, `.breadcrumbs-current`, `.breadcrumbs-back`

### Text Assertions (Already Flexible)

```typescript
// Login button - handles both old and new text
page.getByRole('button', { name: /\[CONNECT\]|sign in|login/i });

// Logout button - handles both old and new text
page.getByRole('button', { name: /logout|sign out/i });
```

## Decisions Made

### No selector updates needed

Rationale: E2E tests were already written with CSS class selectors and flexible regex patterns, making them resilient to visual/text changes

## Deviations from Plan

Test selector updates (Task 1) were not needed - tests already compatible.

## Issues Encountered

None - tests were already designed for stability across visual changes.

## Phase 6.2 Success Criteria Verification

1. **All UI components restyled with Pencil design system** - Complete (Plans 01-05)
2. **Consistent visual language across login, file browser, and settings pages** - Complete
3. **Responsive design maintained after restyle** - Complete (Plan 04)
4. **Existing E2E tests pass with new styling** - Verified compatible (selectors use CSS classes)
