# Phase 6.2 Plan 03: Overlay Components Styling Summary

Terminal-styled context menus, dialogs, modals, and upload UI with green-on-black aesthetic.

## What Was Delivered

Restyled all overlay components (context menus, dialogs, modals, upload UI) to match the terminal aesthetic established in plan 06.2-01. Removed all light mode CSS, applied design tokens throughout, and added green glow effects for consistent visual language.

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Restyle context-menu.css

**Duration:** < 1m | **Commit:** ad043a8

Replaced context menu styling with terminal aesthetic:

- Removed all light mode CSS and `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` queries
- Applied design token variables (`--color-border`, `--color-background`, `--spacing-*`)
- Removed border-radius (sharp corners)
- Added green glow to box-shadow
- Monospace font for menu items
- Green hover states and destructive action styling

**Files modified:**

- `apps/web/src/styles/context-menu.css` - 94 lines

### Task 2: Restyle dialogs.css

**Duration:** < 1m | **Commit:** e33e353

Replaced dialog styling with terminal aesthetic:

- Removed all light mode CSS and prefers-color-scheme queries
- Removed hardcoded colors (no `#ffffff` or light mode hex codes)
- Applied design tokens for all colors, spacing, typography
- Sharp corners on inputs and buttons
- Green glow on focus states
- Monospace font for all dialog text
- Green primary button, red destructive button styling

**Files modified:**

- `apps/web/src/styles/dialogs.css` - 186 lines

### Task 3: Restyle modal.css and upload.css

**Duration:** < 1m | **Commit:** b2b14c0

Replaced modal and upload styling with terminal aesthetic:

- Removed all light mode CSS and prefers-color-scheme queries
- Applied design tokens throughout both files
- Sharp corners on all elements
- Green glow effects on hover/focus
- Monospace font for all text
- Green progress bars in upload UI
- Dashed green border for upload zone

**Files modified:**

- `apps/web/src/styles/modal.css` - 105 lines
- `apps/web/src/styles/upload.css` - 292 lines

## Decisions Made

### Terminal Overlay Aesthetics

Applied terminal aesthetic (green-on-black, monospace font, sharp corners) to all overlay components for visual consistency. Users interact with these components during right-clicks, file operations, and uploads - they must match the main UI's terminal theme.

### Remove Light Mode from Overlays

Removed all `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` queries and light mode defaults. Single dark theme reduces CSS complexity and eliminates the need to maintain dual color schemes across overlay components.

### Sharp Corners on Overlays

Set `border-radius: 0` on all overlay elements (context menus, dialogs, modals, upload zones, buttons). Sharp corners are consistent with terminal/command-line aesthetic and create visual cohesion with the main UI.

### Green Glow Focus States

Added `var(--glow-green)` box-shadow to hover/focus states across all interactive overlay elements. Provides clear visual feedback using the established green color scheme.

## Technical Implementation

### Context Menu

- Green border (`--color-border`) on black background
- Monospace font for menu items
- Green hover state (`--color-green-darker`)
- Red color for destructive actions (delete)
- Green glow on box-shadow

### Dialogs

- Monospace labels with uppercase styling
- Input fields with green focus glow
- Three button variants:
  - Secondary: Transparent with green border
  - Primary: Green background (`--color-green-primary`)
  - Destructive: Red background (`--color-error`)

### Modal

- Darker backdrop (rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8))
- Green border on modal container
- Uppercase monospace title
- Close button with green hover state

### Upload UI

- Dashed green border for drop zone
- Green hover and active states
- Green progress bars
- Monospace text throughout
- Error state with red border and background

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Verification Results

All verification criteria passed:

1. **Context menu styling:** Green border, black background, no light mode CSS
2. **Dialog styling:** Monospace font, green accents, no hardcoded white colors
3. **Modal styling:** Terminal appearance, green border, design tokens used
4. **Upload styling:** Green progress indicators, dashed border, design tokens
5. **No light mode:** Zero `@media (prefers-color-scheme)` queries remaining
6. **Sharp corners:** All `border-radius` values set to 0

Manual verification recommended:

- Right-click a file to see terminal-styled context menu
- Rename a file to see terminal-styled dialog
- Upload a file to see green progress bar
- Delete confirmation shows proper button styling

## Next Phase Readiness

**Status:** Ready

### Blockers

None.

### Prerequisites for Next Plan (06.2-04 or continuation)

- Overlay components now match terminal aesthetic
- Design tokens established and working across overlays
- Can continue restyling remaining UI sections (sidebar, file list)

### Integration Points

- Context menus used in file/folder operations
- Dialogs used for rename, delete confirmation
- Upload modal used for file uploads
- All components ready for user testing

## Performance Notes

- Removed dual theme CSS reduces stylesheet size
- Design token references maintain consistency
- No JavaScript changes required
- CSS-only styling changes
