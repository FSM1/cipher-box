# Phase 6.1: Webapp Automation Testing - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-21
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

E2E UI testing with automation framework that validates critical user flows work correctly. Tests run against the full stack (web app + API + local IPFS) to catch integration issues before they reach production.

</domain>

<decisions>
## Implementation Decisions

### Test framework choice

- Playwright as the E2E testing framework
- Chromium only for browser testing (no Firefox/WebKit)
- Headless mode by default, use `--headed` flag when debugging locally

### User flow coverage

- All four critical flows covered: auth, file operations, folder operations, navigation
- Comprehensive test depth — all paths including edge cases, not just happy path
- Desktop only for now — mobile responsive testing deferred
- Full context menu coverage — test all actions: rename, delete, download, move

### Test data strategy

- Use Web3Auth static test accounts for email passwordless authentication
- Clean slate each test run — wipe test user's vault before suite
- Local IPFS (Kubo in Docker) — no Pinata dependency for tests

### CI integration

- Run E2E tests only on merge to main (not on every PR)
- No automatic retries — fix flakiness immediately when detected
- Full video recording on test failure for debugging
- Sequential test execution initially — parallelize later if duration becomes an issue

### Claude's Discretion

- Test file organization and naming conventions
- Playwright HTML report configuration (for local debugging)
- Specific test assertions and waiting strategies
- Helper utilities and page object patterns

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Web3Auth provides static test accounts for email and phone passwordless — use these rather than mocking auth entirely
- Start sequential, parallelize later if needed — keep it simple first

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- Mobile responsive testing — test at 768px breakpoint and touch interactions
- Multi-browser testing (Firefox, WebKit) — add if cross-browser issues emerge
- Parallel test execution — revisit when test count grows

</deferred>
