## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. E2E smoke test runs successfully

expected: Run `pnpm test:e2e tests/smoke.spec.ts` - Playwright launches browser, homepage loads with CipherBox title and login button visible
result: pass

### 2. Page objects compile without errors

expected: Run `pnpm --filter @cipherbox/e2e exec tsc --noEmit` - TypeScript compiles all page objects (FileListPage, FolderTreePage, ContextMenuPage, etc.) without errors
result: pass

### 3. Web3Auth modal opens on Sign In click

expected: Run `pnpm test:e2e:headed tests/auth/login.spec.ts` - Click "Sign In" button, Web3Auth modal (iframe) appears with email/social login options
result: pass

### 4. Storage state authentication works

expected: With `.auth/user.json` present, run authenticated tests. Tests skip manual login and start pre-authenticated on dashboard.
result: issue
reported: "I tried running `pnpm test:e2e:headed /tests/files/upload.spec.ts` but all these tests still seem to be going through the auth flow (at least based of the logging I am seeing). All the upload tests seem to be broken."
severity: major

### 5. File upload test structure exists

expected: Verify `tests/e2e/tests/files/upload.spec.ts` exists with test cases for single file upload, multiple files, and progress display
result: pass

### 6. Folder operations tests exist

expected: Verify `tests/e2e/tests/folders/` directory has create, rename, delete, navigation test specs (5 files total)
result: pass

### 7. CI workflow configured

expected: Verify `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` exists with postgres + ipfs services, Playwright install, and artifact upload on failure
result: pass

### 8. Cross-browser config present

expected: `playwright.config.ts` has projects for chromium, firefox, webkit browsers (even if only chromium runs by default)
result: pass
note: Chromium-only per CONTEXT.md decision - intentional simplification for v1
