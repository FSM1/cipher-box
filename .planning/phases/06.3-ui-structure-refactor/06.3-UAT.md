## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. AppShell Layout Structure

expected: After login, the app displays a fixed layout with: a header bar at the top showing "> CIPHERBOX" logo, a 180px sidebar on the left, the main content area in the center, and a footer at the bottom. Only the main content area scrolls — header, sidebar, and footer remain fixed.
result: pass

### 2. User Menu Dropdown

expected: Hovering over the user area in the header reveals a dropdown menu with [settings] and [logout] options. Clicking [logout] logs you out. Clicking [settings] navigates to settings page.
result: pass

### 3. Sidebar Navigation

expected: The sidebar shows navigation items with terminal-style labels: [DIR] Files and [CFG] Settings. Clicking them navigates to /files and /settings respectively. The active item is visually highlighted.
result: pass

### 4. Storage Quota in Sidebar

expected: The sidebar displays a storage quota indicator showing used/total (e.g., "0 B / 500.0 MB") with a progress bar.
result: pass

### 5. Connection Status in Footer

expected: The footer shows a [CONNECTED] status indicator (with a glowing dot) along with copyright text and links.
result: pass

### 6. URL-Based Folder Navigation

expected: Navigating into a folder changes the URL to /files/:folderId. Using the browser back/forward buttons navigates between previously visited folders. The root folder is at /files (no folderId parameter).
result: pass

### 7. File List 3-Column Layout

expected: The file list shows three column headers: [NAME] [SIZE] [MODIFIED]. There is no TYPE column. Folders appear first, sorted alphabetically, then files sorted alphabetically.
result: pass

### 8. Parent Directory Navigation ([..] Row)

expected: When inside a subfolder, a [..] PARENT_DIR row appears at the top of the file list. Clicking it navigates up to the parent folder.
result: pass

### 9. Breadcrumbs Path Format

expected: Breadcrumbs display in path format like ~/my vault/subfolder (lowercase, using / separators), not as clickable button segments.
result: pass

### 10. Empty State ASCII Art

expected: When viewing an empty folder, a terminal-style ASCII art folder icon is displayed with a message indicating the folder is empty.
result: issue
reported: "there is a dropzone underneath the ascii art, and I am not a fan of the ascii art chosen. surely you can do something better"
severity: cosmetic

### 11. File Operations Still Work

expected: You can create a folder, upload a file into it, download the file, rename the file/folder, and delete items. All operations complete successfully with the new layout.
result: pass

### 12. Mobile Responsive Layout

expected: At viewport width below 768px: the sidebar collapses/hides, the file list shows only 2 columns (Name and Size, no Modified date), and the layout adapts to a single column.
result: pass

## Gaps

- truth: "Empty folder shows a polished terminal-style ASCII art folder icon with no extraneous elements"
  status: failed
  reason: "User reported: there is a dropzone underneath the ascii art, and I am not a fan of the ascii art chosen. surely you can do something better"
  severity: cosmetic
  test: 10
  root_cause: "EmptyState.tsx renders UploadZone as a separate visible element below the ASCII art, creating a redundant dropzone box. The ASCII art itself is a basic box shape that lacks visual appeal. The entire empty state container already acts as a drop target via the toolbar UploadZone, making the embedded one redundant."
  artifacts:
  - path: "apps/web/src/components/file-browser/EmptyState.tsx"
    issue: "Renders UploadZone component below ASCII art creating visible dropzone box; ASCII art is a basic box shape"
  - path: "apps/web/src/styles/file-browser.css"
    issue: "empty-state-upload class creates visible wrapper for redundant dropzone"
    missing:
  - "Remove or hide the embedded UploadZone from EmptyState (toolbar already has one)"
  - "Replace ASCII art with a more polished terminal-style design"
    debug_session: ""
