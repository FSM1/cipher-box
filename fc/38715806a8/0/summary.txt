The 1Password commit signing is failing consistently. This appears to be an issue with the 1Password agent. Would you like me to wait for you to fix it, or would you prefer to commit these changes yourself? The pre-commit hooks (lint-staged) are passing cleanly — it's only the GPG signing step that fails.

All changes are staged and ready:

**Summary of fixes:**
- **Lint CI**: Fixed 2 prettier formatting errors (`auth.service.ts`, `google-oauth.service.ts`)
- **Test CI**: Added `ThrottlerGuard` override to `auth.controller.spec.ts` (fixes 26 failing tests)
- **E2E CI**: Added `TEST_LOGIN_SECRET` to E2E workflow so tests use test-login endpoint bypass
- **CodeRabbit comments** (12 of 15 addressed with code changes):
  - Resolved merge conflict markers in `STATE.md`
  - Added `'corekit'` to `LoginDto` `@ApiProperty` enum
  - Removed PII (email) from `testLogin` log
  - Fixed OTP range to include `999999`
  - Return email from identity endpoints for Google login UI display
  - Race condition handling for duplicate auth methods
  - Throw on vault keypair failure instead of silent return
  - Set `userEmail` in Google login flow
  - Extracted shared `loginWithCoreKit()` to reduce duplication
  - Removed unused imports from `useAuth`
  - Deleted stray `cipherbox-test.txt`
  - Added final security review report
- **3 remaining CodeRabbit comments** are on documentation files (security review doc notes) — not actionable code changes
