ok lets get back to main

I had a quick question about the subfolder ipns keys - are these random so that a folder can be shared with another user (in the next phase) allowing them to update the folder metadata (children) without exposing any other keys? am I interpretting this correctly?

---

<objective>
List all pending todos, allow selection, load full context for the selected todo, and route to appropriate action.

Enables reviewing captured ideas and deciding what to work on next.
</objective>

<context>
@.planning/STATE.md
@.planning/ROADMAP.md
</context>

<process>

<step name="check_exist">
```bash
TODO_COUNT=$(ls .planning/todos/pending/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
echo "Pending todos: $TODO_COUNT"
```

If count is 0:
```
No pending todos.

Todos are captured during work sessions with /gsd:add-todo.

---

Would you like to:

1. Continue with current phase (/gsd:progress)
2. Add a todo now (/gsd:add-todo)
```

Exit.
</step>

<step name="parse_filter">
Check for area filter in arguments:
- `/gsd:check-todos` → show all
- `/gsd:check-todos api` → filter to area:api only
</step>

<step name="list_todos">
```bash
for file in .planning/todos/pending/*.md; do
  created=$(grep "^created:" "$file" | cut -d' ' -f2)
  title=$(grep "^title:" "$file" | cut -d':' -f2- | xargs)
  area=$(grep "^area:" "$file" | cut -d' ' -f2)
  echo "$created|$title|$area|$file"
done | sort
```

Apply area filter if specified. Display as numbered list:

```
Pending Todos:

1. Add auth token refresh (api, 2d ago)
2. Fix modal z-index issue (ui, 1d ago)
3. Refactor database connection pool (database, 5h ago)

---

Reply with a number to view details, or:
- `/gsd:check-todos [area]` to filter by area
- `q` to exit
```

Format age as relative time.
</step>

<step name="handle_selection">
Wait for user to reply with a number.

If valid: load selected todo, proceed.
If invalid: "Invalid selection. Reply with a number (1-[N]) or `q` to exit."
</step>

<step name="load_context">
Read the todo file completely. Display:

```
## [title]

**Area:** [area]
**Created:** [date] ([relative time] ago)
**Files:** [list or "None"]

### Problem
[problem section content]

### Solution
[solution section content]
```

If `files` field has entries, read and briefly summarize each.
</step>

<step name="check_roadmap">
```bash
ls .planning/ROADMAP.md 2>/dev/null && echo "Roadmap exists"
```

If roadmap exists:
1. Check if todo's area matches an upcoming phase
2. Check if todo's files overlap with a phase's scope
3. Note any match for action options
</step>

<step name="offer_actions">
**If todo maps to a roadmap phase:**

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Action"
- question: "This todo relates to Phase [N]: [name]. What would you like to do?"
- options:
  - "Work on it now" — move to done, start working
  - "Add to phase plan" — include when planning Phase [N]
  - "Brainstorm approach" — think through before deciding
  - "Put it back" — return to list

**If no roadmap match:**

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Action"
- question: "What would you like to do with this todo?"
- options:
  - "Work on it now" — move to done, start working
  - "Create a phase" — /gsd:add-phase with this scope
  - "Brainstorm approach" — think through before deciding
  - "Put it back" — return to list
</step>

<step name="execute_action">
**Work on it now:**
```bash
mv ".planning/todos/pending/[filename]" ".planning/todos/done/"
```
Update STATE.md todo count. Present problem/solution context. Begin work or ask how to proceed.

**Add to phase plan:**
Note todo reference in phase planning notes. Keep in pending. Return to list or exit.

**Create a phase:**
Display: `/gsd:add-phase [description from todo]`
Keep in pending. User runs command in fresh context.

**Brainstorm approach:**
Keep in pending. Start discussion about problem and approaches.

**Put it back:**
Return to list_todos step.
</step>

<step name="update_state">
After any action that changes todo count:

```bash
ls .planning/todos/pending/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```

Update STATE.md "### Pending Todos" section if exists.
</step>

<step name="git_commit">
If todo was moved to done/, commit the change:

```bash
git add .planning/todos/done/[filename]
git rm --cached .planning/todos/pending/[filename] 2>/dev/null || true
[ -f .planning/STATE.md ] && git add .planning/STATE.md
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
docs: start work on todo - [title]

Moved to done/, beginning implementation.
EOF
)"
```

Confirm: "Committed: docs: start work on todo - [title]"
</step>

</process>

<output>
- Moved todo to `.planning/todos/done/` (if "Work on it now")
- Updated `.planning/STATE.md` (if todo count changed)
</output>

<anti_patterns>
- Don't delete todos — move to done/ when work begins
- Don't start work without moving to done/ first
- Don't create plans from this command — route to /gsd:plan-phase or /gsd:add-phase
</anti_patterns>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] All pending todos listed with title, area, age
- [ ] Area filter applied if specified
- [ ] Selected todo's full context loaded
- [ ] Roadmap context checked for phase match
- [ ] Appropriate actions offered
- [ ] Selected action executed
- [ ] STATE.md updated if todo count changed
- [ ] Changes committed to git (if todo moved to done/)

yes please

ok lets get back to main again

---

in the metadata schemas doc, section 14 ipns key derivation, there no mention of folder ipns records. why?

---

ok, this brings up the question of why the file ipns entry key is deterministic - should it not also be random so that certain users can be given rights to edit the file (upload new content and update the ipns entry to point at the new cid.

---

so unless I am misunderstanding the recovery process, but the recovery tool would have to traverse the tree in any case to obtain file and folder metadata, so this jsutification really does not make a lot of sense to me.

---

Yes add a gsd todo regarding this, and make sure it mentions updating the note in state.md when the todo is complete.

ok lets get back to main
