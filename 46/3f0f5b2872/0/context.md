### Prompt 5

could you set the build linux desktop task as required?

### Prompt 6

ok now fogire out why the macos build failed on CI

### Prompt 7

Ok the macos build is failing on the debug build step. One thing I didn't realise is that having these debug build steps in the main ci workflow is really slowing things down.

Maybe it makes sense to implement something like this:
PR CI only runs the cargo checks (if changes are detected)
once merged to main, run the debug build, execute the e2e desktop suite of test, and only if these pass, then build the production releases. Happy to hear alternative proposals.

### Prompt 8
