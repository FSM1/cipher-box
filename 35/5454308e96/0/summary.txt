API recompiled and restarted cleanly. And IPNS even resolved successfully this time. Here's a summary of the changes:

**Backend:**
- `auth.service.ts`: `refreshByToken` now queries the user's `email_passwordless` auth method and returns the email
- `auth.controller.ts`: Passes `email` through in the refresh response (both web and desktop)
- `dto/token.dto.ts`: Added optional `email` field to `TokenResponseDto` and `RefreshServiceResult`

**Frontend:**
- `lib/api/auth.ts`: Added `email?: string` to `TokenResponse` type
- `hooks/useAuth.ts`: Sets `userEmail` from refresh response during session restore
- `components/layout/UserMenu.tsx`: Fallback changed from `'User'` to `'[an0n]'`

Now on session refresh, the backend returns the email from the auth method table — no PII stored locally, and `[an0n]` shows when no email is available (e.g. Google login).
