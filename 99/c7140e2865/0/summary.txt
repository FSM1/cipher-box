All 6 files changed/created as planned. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

**Created:**
1. `.claude/commands/design/sync.md` — The main `/design:sync` skill with 10-step process: pre-flight, identify changed files, build CSS-to-frame mapping (3-tier), extract impl values, extract design values, normalized comparison, discrepancy report, resolution prompt, apply changes, summary

**Modified:**
2. `.claude/commands/gsd/quick.md` — Added Step 6c (design sync check for UI tasks, non-blocking, defaults to "update design to match code")
3. `.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/execute-phase.md` — Added `design_sync_check` step between `verify_phase_goal` and `update_roadmap`
4. `.claude/commands/gsd/execute-phase.md` — Added step 8 (design sync check), renumbered subsequent steps 9-12
5. `.claude/commands/gsd/verify-work.md` — Added `/design:sync check` to "Also available" in Routes A and B
6. `.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/verify-work.md` — Added `/design:sync check` to the "all tests passed" output

**Updated:**
7. `MEMORY.md` — Corrected UI keyword sync note (4 locations, removed stale gsd-verifier reference)

The skill is already recognized by Claude Code (visible in the skills list as `design:sync`). Would you like me to commit these changes?
