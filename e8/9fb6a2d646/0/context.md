**Commit Message:** Hmmm, still seeing the uuid displayed in the top bar.

## Prompt

hmmm, still seeing the uuid displayed in the top bar.

## Summary

API recompiled — but that also means another new ephemeral keypair. You'll need to wait a bit for Web3Auth's JWKS cache to pick up the new key before logging in again. Give it a minute or two, then try. The backfill logic will now update the UUID identifier to the real email on login.
