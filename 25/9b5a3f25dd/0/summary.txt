API compiled cleanly. Summary of what changed:

1. **JWT issuer** now includes `email` claim in identity JWTs
2. **Identity controller** passes email to `signIdentityJwt` for both Google and email OTP flows
3. **Auth service** extracts email from JWT and uses it as the auth method identifier (falling back to `sub` if no email)
4. **Refresh endpoint** returns the email from the user's `email_passwordless` auth method
5. **Frontend** sets `userEmail` from refresh response during session restore
6. **UserMenu** shows `[an0n]` when no email is available

You'll need to log in fresh for the email to be stored correctly in the auth method (the old auth method still has the UUID). Want to test it?
